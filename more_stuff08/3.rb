# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?
#My answer: Exception handling allows a program to deal with errors/exceptions without stopping. It solves the problem of errors stopping the program.
# Right Answer: Exception handling is a structure used to handle the possibility of an error occuring in the program. It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely.
